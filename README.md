# 3dDa2d
Im working on raycasting part (ray*, scene wall)
current ver of cube3d have no raycast parts in Makefile
Can get different xpm and test parsing 
with different maps , check whether it can detect valid map or not
and does it store it properly
xpm files of different sizes
Memory leak and SegFault
